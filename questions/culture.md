### Customer Obession

* Example 2:

### Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long-term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond their own team. They never say "that's not my job".

* Example 1: 

* Example 2:

### Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas everywhere, and are not limited by "not invented here". As we do new things, we accept taht we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.

* Example 1: styled components

* Example 2: docker and ease of deployment

### Are Right, A Lot:

### Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms like career choice.

* Example 1: faciliate junior engineers career and technical knowledge even outside the workplace

### Insist on the Highest Standards:
Leaders have relentlessly high standards-many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and their problems are fixes so they stay fixed.

* Example 1: practical jokes are made about code reviews by senior members, but i stand up for the changes i ask for. jsonp was almost used in a recent endpoint 

* Example 2: actively working on refactoring legacy code to ensure that it is up to date with react applicaiton structure, PIP standards, Django standards etc

### Think Big

### Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

### Frugality: Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budge size or fixed expense.

* Example 1: When creating BoostOurTeam we had a constraint of using RedHat OpenShift. We were gifted into a young entrupreneurs program and while I would have loved to switch the architecture to EC2 we operated with an extremely low overhead.....

* Example 2:

* Example 1: 

* Example 2:

### Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team's body order smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

* Example 1: when junior devs ask for code reviews from the CTO, the first question he asks if "did Dylan review it?" and if the answer is a postive, he will simply say its okay to push.

* Example 2:

### Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

* Example 1: 

* Example 2:

### Have Backbone
Disagree and Commit: Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decisoin is determined, they commit wholly
